# Real-Time-Speaker-Recognition
This is a speaker recognition system built mainly for conference where multiple speakers share a single microphone. In such situation, it's easy to lose track on the identity of the current speaker. So we came up with a solution that blends well with such situation.

## Dependency
We've used a few libraries for this work. The libraries we used includes:
### OpenAL
> ALC version: 1.1
### Qt
> Qt version 5.7.1
### HTK
> HTK version 3.4.1
