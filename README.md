# Real-Time-Speaker-Recognition
This is a speaker recognition system built mainly for conference where multiple speakers share a single microphone. In such situation, it's easy to lose track on the identity of the current speaker. So we came up with a solution that blends well with such situation.

## Dependency and Environment
We've used a few libraries for this work. The libraries we used includes:
### Libraries
#### OpenAL
> ALC version: 1.1

#### Qt
> Qt version 5.7.1

#### HTK
> HTK version 3.4.1

### Environment
#### Architecture
> x86_64 GNU/Linux

#### Compiler
> gcc version 6.2.1 20160830 (GCC)

## Installation
The main development would be in the **Qt** directory.
The file in **CLI** directory is the CLI version of this work.
